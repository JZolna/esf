\subsubsection{Description/additional circuitry}
% Describe how your electronic hardware brake plausibility system works (this is in addition to your ECU controlled brake plausibility software), provide tables with main operation parameters, and describe additional circuitry used to check or for an implausibility. Describe how the system reacts if an implausibility or error is detected.

BSPD is represented by a PCB with an on-board current transducer. Brake state signal is received via wiring from ECUP. Output controls Gate of a MOSFET, that acts as a “normally-closed” switch in SDC loop. In case of a trip event output changes state and gets latched till a GLVMS restart.
