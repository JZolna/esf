\subsection{Description/additional circuitry}
Car is using two pressure sensors as encoders for brake pedal. Each one is for separate brake system. Sensors are powered and measured by ECU-P, same unit as \label{sec:TorqueEncoder}. Pressure sensors output analog voltage signal equal to brake system pressure.

\subsection{Brake Encoder Plausability Check}
Implausability is not checked, because eForce does not use brake pedal information to control motor controllers.

\subsection{Wiring}
Describe the wiring, show schematics, show data regarding the cables and connectors used.

\subsubsection{Position in car/mechanical fastening/mechanical connection}
Provide CAD-renderings showing all relevant parts and discuss the mechanical connection of the sensors to the pedal assembly. Mark the parts in the rendering, if necessary.
