\subsubsection{Description}
%Describe the housing used and how it can be accessed, etc.  Describe how the measurement points protected/covered when not in use and how the electrical connections on the back of the measurement points are protected when the measurement points are being used.

High voltage measurement points (HVMP) are placed in the Service box. When not in use, they are covered with protective cups made from silicone rubber. From backside they are protected by sealed Service box all the time.
\subsubsection{Wiring, connectors, cables}
%Describe wiring, show schematics, and describe connectors and cables used and show useful data regarding the wiring.  Include details on the protection resistor including resistance, voltage and power rating.

They are connected to ECUB (by Harness\_G with connector G1). In ECUB is TSAL switch circuit and discharge circuit is in ECUM (ECUM is connected to ECUB by Harness\_E â€“ connectors are E1 from ECUB and E2 into ECUM Rear).
HVMP wires will be connected to the board in ECUB box, where is TSAL switch circuit, discharge circuit and 2 resistors 15k 1W (R1, R2) for HVMP. Value of this resistor can be measured from measuring points by multimeter with switched TSMS off.

\subsubsection{Position in car}
%Provide CAD-renderings showing the relevant parts. Mark the parts in the rendering, if necessary.

Measure points are placed on panel next to Master switches and HVD, see \ref{fig:SDC-positionInCar}.
